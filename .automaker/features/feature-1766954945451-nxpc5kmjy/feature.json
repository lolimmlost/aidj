  "description": "Review and Refactor Discover-to-Playlist Media Flow\n\nAnalyze and improve the logic that handles the process of discovering media content, downloading it, and inserting it into the currently active playlist.\n\nRequirements:\n- Audit the complete flow from content discovery through playlist insertion\n- Identify potential race conditions or error states in the download process\n- Verify proper error handling when downloads fail or are interrupted\n- Ensure downloaded content is correctly queued and inserted at appropriate playlist position\n- Check for duplicate detection (prevent adding same content twice)\n- Validate state management throughout the multi-step process\n- Review user feedback mechanisms (loading states, progress indicators, success/error messages)\n- Document any assumptions or dependencies between the discover, download, and playlist systems\n\nEdge Cases to Consider:\n- User navigates away during download\n- Playlist is modified or deleted while download is in progress\n- Network interruption during download\n- Insufficient storage space\n- Content becomes unavailable between discovery and download completion",
