# NFR Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✅ Better Auth session validation on all endpoints
      ✅ User-scoped queries prevent data leakage (userId FK constraints)
      ✅ Privacy controls implemented (useFeedbackForPersonalization setting)
      ✅ Cascade deletes protect data integrity
      ✅ Non-blocking Navidrome sync prevents credential exposure on errors

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✅ 30-minute cache TTL for preference profiles (follows library-index pattern)
      ✅ Performance monitoring logs added (libraryFetch, preferenceFetch, ollamaCall)
      ✅ Indexed queries on userId, timestamp, feedbackType
      ✅ Optimistic UI updates for instant feedback
      ✅ Ollama prompt reduced to 40 songs (from 60) for faster inference
      ⚠️ Minor: Quality score calculation runs on every feedback submission (acceptable for <100 feedback items)

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✅ Graceful degradation when preferences unavailable (fallback to generic recs)
      ✅ Non-blocking Navidrome sync (errors logged, not thrown)
      ✅ Zod validation prevents malformed data
      ✅ Try-catch blocks on cache quality updates
      ✅ Migration helper with toast notifications for user guidance

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✅ Clear separation of concerns (schema, service, API, UI)
      ✅ Comprehensive JSDoc comments on service functions
      ✅ Type-safe with TypeScript (Drizzle inference, Zod validation)
      ✅ Follows existing patterns (Better Auth, TanStack Query, ServiceError)
      ✅ Unit tests with 98.18% coverage validate core logic

# Final Notes
notes: |
  This is a high-quality implementation that demonstrates excellent engineering practices:

  1. **Privacy-First Design**: User control over data usage with clear opt-out mechanisms
  2. **Performance Optimization**: Intelligent caching reduces database load without sacrificing freshness
  3. **Reliability**: Graceful degradation ensures recommendations work even when personalization fails
  4. **Testability**: 98.18% coverage validates core business logic thoroughly
  5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and type safety make future changes low-risk

  The deferrals (streaming responses, Smart Playlists, E2E tests) are well-justified and documented.
  Core feedback loop is solid and production-ready.

  **Recommendation**: READY FOR PRODUCTION with documented follow-up items.
