# Sprint Planning for Epic 3: AI Recommendations Engine

## Sprint Goal
Implement core Ollama integration and recommendation display to enable basic AI music discovery (Stories 3.1 and 3.2; 10 points).

## Sprint Details
- **Duration:** 1 week, starting 2025-09-20
- **Team:** Product Owner, Full Stack Developer, UX Expert
- **Daily Standups:** 15-min meetings at 9 AM UTC-7
- **Sprint Review:** End of day 5 (2025-09-25)
- **Definition of Done:** Code merged, tests passing (>80% coverage), demo of recommendation flow, docs updated

## Assigned Tasks

### Story 3.1: Ollama API Integration (5 points, 3-5 days)
- **As a developer, I want to implement API integration with Ollama, so that the application can generate music recommendations.**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Create service layer for making API calls to Ollama (src/lib/services/ollama.ts)
  2. Implement model selection functionality (e.g., default to llama3)
  3. Handle API responses and parse recommendation results (JSON format for tracks/artists)
  4. Implement error handling for model loading issues (timeouts, retries)
  5. Add retry mechanisms for failed API calls (exponential backoff)
  6. Implement caching for recommendations to reduce API calls (TanStack Query or localStorage)
- **Assignee:** Full Stack Developer
- **Dependencies:** Ollama running locally (http://localhost:11434); existing config from Epic 1
- **Risks:** Model loading delays—mitigate with 5s timeouts and fallback messages

### Story 3.2: Recommendation Display and Interaction (5 points, 3-5 days)
- **As a user, I want to see AI-generated music recommendations, so that I can discover new music based on my preferences.**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Create recommendation display section on the main dashboard (src/routes/dashboard/index.tsx)
  2. Implement different recommendation types (similar artists, mood-based, etc.) via prompts
  3. Allow users to provide feedback on recommendations (thumbs up/down buttons)
  4. Create detailed recommendation view with explanations (modal or route)
  5. Implement functionality to add recommended songs to play queue (integrate with audio store)
  6. Display recommendation generation timestamp
- **Assignee:** UX Expert / Full Stack Developer
- **Dependencies:** Story 3.1 complete; Navidrome data from Epic 2 for prompts
- **Risks:** UI integration—mitigate with wireframes review

## Sprint Backlog Refinement
- Post-sprint: Refine Stories 3.3-3.5 based on demo feedback (e.g., caching details, analytics opt-in)

## Metrics
- Velocity Target: 10 points
- Burndown: Track daily progress in shared doc
