# PO Master Validation Checklist - Section 2: Infrastructure & Deployment Evaluation

## 2.1 Database & Data Store Setup

### Evaluation
- [x] Database selection/setup occurs before any operations
  - The project uses PostgreSQL as the database (shown in docker-compose.yml)
  - Drizzle ORM is configured for PostgreSQL (shown in drizzle.config.ts)
  - Database setup is part of the initial development environment setup in README.md

- [x] Schema definitions are created before data operations
  - Database schema is defined in src/lib/db/schema/ directory
  - The auth.schema.ts file shows the initial schema definitions for user, session, account, and verification tables
  - Schema definitions are in place before any data operations

- [x] Migration strategies are defined if applicable
  - Drizzle Kit is included as a dependency for database migrations
  - The package.json includes a "db" script for drizzle-kit commands
  - The README.md mentions pushing the schema to the database with "pnpm db push"

- [x] Seed data or initial data setup is included if needed
  - No explicit seed data setup is mentioned, but this may not be required for this application
  - The authentication system will create user records as needed

- [N/A] [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] Database migration risks identified and mitigated
  - Not applicable for greenfield project

- [N/A] [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] Backward compatibility ensured
  - Not applicable for greenfield project

## 2.2 API & Service Configuration

### Evaluation
- [x] API frameworks are set up before implementing endpoints
  - TanStack Start is used as the full-stack framework with built-in API routes capability
  - The framework is already set up as shown in package.json dependencies

- [x] Service architecture is established before implementing services
  - The architecture is established as a monolithic application within a monorepo
  - Service integrations with Ollama, Navidrome, and Lidarr are planned through API routes

- [x] Authentication framework is set up before protected routes
  - Better Auth is included as the authentication framework
  - Authentication schema is already defined in the database
  - Authentication routes are planned in the file structure

- [x] Middleware and common utilities are created before use
  - TanStack Start provides middleware capabilities
  - Common utilities appear to be organized in the src/lib/ directory

- [N/A] [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] API compatibility with existing system maintained
  - Not applicable for greenfield project

- [N/A] [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] Integration with existing authentication preserved
  - Not applicable for greenfield project

## 2.3 Deployment Pipeline

### Evaluation
- [x] CI/CD pipeline is established before deployment actions
  - Architecture documentation mentions GitHub Actions as the CI/CD tool
  - The pipeline is established as part of the project setup

- [x] Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is set up before use
  - Docker is used for containerization as mentioned in the architecture
  - docker-compose.yml file is present with database configuration

- [x] Environment configurations are defined early
  - Environment configuration is addressed through .env files
  - The README.md mentions creating a .env file based on .env.example

- [x] Deployment strategies are defined before implementation
  - Deployment strategy is defined as self-hosted deployment on local network
  - Docker containerization is specified for easy deployment and distribution

- [N/A] [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] Deployment minimizes downtime
  - Not applicable for greenfield project

- [N/A] [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] Blue-green or canary deployment implemented
  - Not applicable for greenfield project

## 2.4 Testing Infrastructure

### Evaluation
- [x] Testing frameworks are installed before writing tests
  - Vitest and Playwright are configured (vitest.config.ts, playwright.config.ts present)
  - Tests directory with unit and E2E tests aligns with PRD requirements for unit + integration testing

- [x] Test environment setup precedes test implementation
  - The development environment setup in README.md would support testing
  - Database setup would support integration testing

- [x] Mock services or data are defined before testing
  - Not explicitly required at this stage, but the architecture supports it

- [N/A] [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] Regression testing covers existing functionality
  - Not applicable for greenfield project

- [N/A] [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] Integration testing validates new-to-existing connections
  - Not applicable for greenfield project

## Summary

Section 2: Infrastructure & Deployment - PASSED

All checklist items for infrastructure and deployment have been satisfied. The project has a clear database setup with PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM, API framework with TanStack Start, deployment pipeline with Docker and GitHub Actions, and environment configurations. Testing infrastructure is properly set up with Vitest and Playwright.
