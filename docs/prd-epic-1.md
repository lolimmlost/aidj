# Music Recommendation and Download Interface Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

## Epic Goal

Establish the foundational project structure, implement user authentication, and create the basic configuration system for connecting to local services. This epic will deliver a working application shell with secure access and the ability to configure connections to Ollama, Navidrome, and Lidarr services.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Basic Structure

As a developer,
I want to set up the project with a monorepo structure containing frontend and backend components,
so that I can begin implementing the application features.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Create project repository with appropriate directory structure
2. Set up package.json with project metadata and dependencies
3. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality standards
4. Set up basic Git configuration with initial commit
5. Create README with project description and setup instructions

## Story 1.2: User Authentication System

As a user,
I want to securely log in to the application,
so that my preferences and settings are protected.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Implement user registration functionality with secure password storage
2. Create login interface with username and password fields
3. Implement session management with secure tokens
4. Add logout functionality
5. Create protected routes that require authentication
6. Implement proper error handling for authentication failures

## Story 1.3: Service Configuration Interface

As a user,
I want to configure connections to my local Ollama, Navidrome, and Lidarr services,
so that the application can communicate with these services.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Create configuration screen with fields for service URLs and credentials
2. Implement form validation for configuration inputs
3. Store configuration securely in local storage or database
4. Provide test connection functionality for each service
5. Display connection status indicators for each service
6. Implement proper error handling for configuration issues
