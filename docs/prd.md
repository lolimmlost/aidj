# Music Recommendation and Download Interface Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Create a unified web interface for music discovery, streaming, and downloading using local self-hosted services
- Integrate with Ollama for privacy-focused AI music recommendations
- Enable seamless music streaming through Navidrome integration
- Facilitate music downloads through Lidarr integration
- Provide an intuitive user experience for managing personal music collections
- Maintain all data processing local to preserve user privacy

### Background Context
This project addresses the need for a unified interface to manage personal music collections using self-hosted services. Many music enthusiasts run local instances of Ollama, Navidrome, and Lidarr but lack a cohesive interface to manage all these services together. The solution will provide AI-powered recommendations without compromising privacy by leveraging a local LLM, while also enabling easy streaming and downloading of music through existing self-hosted infrastructure.
