  "id": "feature-1766887111413-mre1tf6n6",
  "steps": [
    "Audit components with multiple re-renders (especially AnalyticsDashboard, QueuePanel, PlaylistList) using React DevTools Profiler",
    "Wrap computed data transformations in useMemo hooks in components like AnalyticsDashboard (e.g., chart data preparation)",
    "Apply React.memo to components that receive complex props but don't change frequently (TasteProfileCard, MetricCard helpers)",
    "Add stable callback functions using useCallback in data-heavy components (AudioPlayer, QueuePanel)",
    "Profile again to verify reduction in re-renders and measure performance improvement"
