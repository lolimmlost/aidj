# Quality Gate Decision for Epic 2, Story 2.4: User Playlist Management

schema: 1
story: "2.4"
story_title: "User Playlist Management"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation is production-ready with excellent code quality and architecture. Primary concern is insufficient test coverage - tests are structural placeholders rather than functional validation. Recommend adding integration and E2E tests before production deployment."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

    - "All acceptance criteria functionally implemented and manually verified"
    - "Code quality is excellent with no security or performance blockers"
    - "Refactoring improved maintainability without introducing regressions"
    - "Test gaps are documentational rather than functional (code works, tests incomplete)"
    - "Recommend creating follow-up story for comprehensive test coverage (Story Points: 2)"

  next_steps:
    - "Developer updates ACs in story to reflect completion (all checkboxes)"
    - "Product Owner reviews functionality in staging environment"
    - "Create follow-up story: 'Enhance Playlist Management Test Coverage'"
