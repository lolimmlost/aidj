nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Proper authentication checks via auth.api.getSession, user-scoped data queries, no data leakage. Cache is user-scoped and server-side only.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: '1-hour cache TTL implemented, query optimization via time-range limits (max 1 year), selective metric fetching via query parameters, Shannon entropy calculations efficient for current scale.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling in API endpoint, graceful degradation with empty states, cache invalidation strategy in place, proper TypeScript typing reduces runtime errors.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean separation of concerns (service/API/UI layers), well-documented code with JSDoc comments, TypeScript interfaces exported for reusability, consistent naming conventions, 93.85% test coverage.'

code_quality_highlights:
  - 'Clean TypeScript with exported interfaces for API consumers'
  - 'Proper separation: service layer (analytics.ts) → API (analytics endpoint) → UI (AnalyticsDashboard.tsx)'
  - 'Shannon entropy implementation for diversity scoring is mathematically sound'
  - '1-hour cache TTL balances freshness vs performance'
  - 'Graceful empty states for users with < 5 feedback entries'
  - 'Responsive design with mobile-friendly charts'
  - 'Query parameter design allows selective metric fetching (performance optimization)'

security_notes:
  - 'User-scoped queries prevent data leakage (WHERE userId = session.user.id)'
  - 'Authentication enforced via auth.api.getSession before data access'
  - 'No sensitive data exposure in analytics (artist names only, no user PII)'
  - 'Cache is server-side in-memory, no client-side storage of analytics'
