# NFR Assessment: epic-3.story-3.6

Date: 2025-09-20
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - Encrypted localStorage and privacy toggle planned but not implemented
- Performance: CONCERNS - 5s timeout for Ollama planned, but no load testing
- Reliability: CONCERNS - Error handling and retry logic planned, validation pending
- Maintainability: PASS - Comprehensive test design with 24 scenarios covering all ACs

## Critical Issues

1. **Encryption Implementation** (Security)
   - Risk: Medium - Feedback data could be exposed if encryption not properly applied
   - Fix: Implement and unit test encryption/decryption in localStorage handlers (~1 hour)

2. **Performance Validation** (Performance)
   - Risk: Medium - Ollama calls may exceed 5s under load without monitoring
   - Fix: Add integration tests with timeout mocks and recommend perf monitoring (~2 hours)

3. **Retry Logic Verification** (Reliability)
   - Risk: Low - Potential infinite retries or no fallback if not capped
   - Fix: Unit test retry mechanism with failure simulations (~1 hour)

## Quick Wins

- Validate planned encryption in unit tests: ~1 hour
- Mock timeout in integration tests: ~1 hour
- Document NFR thresholds in story: ~30 min
- Extend test design with perf scenarios: ~2 hours

Quality Score: 70/100 (CONCERNS on 3 NFRs, PASS on maintainability)
