# TODO

## Audio / iOS

- [x] Improve fade-in smoothness when transitioning back from iOS background — there's still a slight audible pause. The settle delay (30ms quick bounce / 150ms long interrupt) before the 200ms fade-in in `useWebAudioGraph.ts` may be too aggressive. Consider starting reconnect at a low non-zero gain instead of 0, or reducing the settle delay.
- [ ] iOS lock screen controls sometimes missing on first lock of a fresh session. On unlock→re-lock cycle, pitch shift can reappear. May be related to MediaSession not being set up in time, or the source reload on app switch interfering with lock screen recovery path.
- [ ] iOS audio loss on lock/app-switch — root cause identified: the interrupted handler aggressively mutes (element.volume=0 + masterGain.disconnect()) to prevent pitch artifacts, but the visibility return handler only called ctx.resume() without reconnecting the graph. Fixed visibility handler to do full reconnection. If still occurring, investigate whether the HTMLAudioElement stream itself dies (network timeout on the Navidrome stream URL while backgrounded).

- [ ] Fix cross-device skip: rapid skips from iPhone leave desktop with `isPlaying=false` and WS disconnect
- [ ] Cross-device playback handoff: when user is playing music on phone and also has desktop session open, when song ends on phone the desktop session should pick up playback (Spotify Connect-style transfer)
- [ ] Cross-device position sync (multiple related bugs):
  - WS should continuously broadcast playback position (every ~5s) so other sessions stay current
  - `loadSong` resets `currentTime` to 0 on reconnect, then `savePlaybackState` fires and overwrites the real saved position with `0.0s` — need to guard against saving 0 when a valid position was previously known
  - Pressing play on a passive session should seek to the last known position from the active session, not restart from 0 or a stale sync point
  - Tab visibility changes on desktop may trigger unnecessary song reloads that reset position

- [ ] Stale session resume has no volume: when a session sits inactive for a while and user presses play, audio plays but with no volume. Forcing a visibility change (switching tabs and back) fixes it and playback resumes with sound — and interestingly with no click at all. Likely the AudioContext or masterGain is in a bad state after long idle and only the visibility change recovery path properly reconnects it.

## Performance

- [ ] Media Session handlers re-registering excessively — `PlayerBar.tsx` sets up Media Session handlers ~50+ times per page load due to an effect re-running too often. Needs dep array audit or guard to only register once per song change.
- [ ] React hydration error #418 on every page load — SSR/client HTML mismatch. Likely a component rendering differently on server vs client (e.g. reading localStorage, window, or timestamps during SSR).

## UI / UX

- [ ] Add fullscreen song view — tap album art or expand button to show immersive full-screen now-playing with large artwork, controls, lyrics, and swipe-to-dismiss
- [x] Improve toasts — centralized toast wrapper with per-type durations (success 3s, error 6s, info 4s, warning 5s), close buttons, max 4 visible
- [ ] Logout page invalidation — invalidate router/query cache on sign-out for instant redirect to login instead of stale page flash
- [x] Redesign login page — improve visual design, branding, and UX

## DevOps

- [ ] Switch Coolify deployment back to `main` branch and merge `feat/web-audio-crossfade` into `main`

## Lidarr / Downloads

- [ ] Add option to monitor a specific album or song in Lidarr instead of pulling full artist discography — check how the CSV playlist import handles this (it likely uses `POST /api/v1/album` or search+add per album rather than artist-level monitoring)
- [ ] Make playlist import easier — support pasting a playlist link (Spotify, YouTube Music, Apple Music) and auto-resolve tracks instead of requiring manual CSV upload
