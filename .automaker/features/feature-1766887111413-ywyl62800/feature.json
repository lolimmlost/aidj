  "description": "Implement Incremental Library Indexing with Background Synchronization\n\nCreate a system that efficiently indexes library content incrementally and keeps the index synchronized in the background without blocking the main application.\n\nRequirements:\n- Design an incremental indexing mechanism that only processes new or modified items since last sync\n- Implement background synchronization that runs without impacting UI responsiveness\n- Track last sync timestamp and change detection (file modified dates, checksums, or version markers)\n- Handle interruptions gracefully - resume from last checkpoint if sync is stopped\n- Provide progress indicators showing indexing status (items processed, remaining, errors)\n- Implement efficient delta detection to minimize redundant processing\n- Add conflict resolution strategy for concurrent modifications\n- Include error handling for missing files, permission issues, and corrupted data\n- Optimize memory usage for large libraries by processing in batches\n- Store index metadata separately from content for quick access\n- Add configuration options for sync frequency and resource limits\n- Ensure thread-safety if using multi-threaded indexing\n- Log sync activity for debugging and monitoring\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- Initial full index completes successfully\n- Subsequent syncs only process changed items\n- Background sync doesn't degrade application performance\n- Index remains consistent with source library\n- System recovers gracefully from failures",

  "steps": [
    "Modify buildLibraryIndex() to index songs incrementally in batches of 100 instead of blocking on 1500 songs",
    "Use requestIdleCallback() or setTimeout to allow UI updates between batch processing",
    "Cache partial index results so UI can display results as they're indexed rather than waiting for completion",
    "Add periodic background sync using Web Workers to update library index without blocking main thread",
    "Show loading progress percentage so users see indexing is working (currently no visual feedback)"
