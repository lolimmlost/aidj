# Project Brief: Music Recommendation and Download Interface

## Executive Summary

This project aims to create a web-based interface that connects to a local Ollama instance for AI-powered music recommendations, integrates with Navidrome for music streaming, and connects to Lidarr for downloading requested songs. All services are hosted on the local network (LAN), making this a privacy-focused personal music management solution.

## Problem Statement

Music enthusiasts with extensive local collections often struggle to:
- Discover new music that matches their preferences
- Easily access their entire music library through a unified interface
- Request and download new music in an organized manner
- Leverage AI recommendations without compromising privacy (using local LLMs)

Current solutions either lack integration between services or require sending data to external services, compromising user privacy.

## Proposed Solution

A web application that:
1. Interfaces with a local Ollama instance to provide AI-powered music recommendations based on user preferences and listening history
2. Connects to Navidrome to stream and play music from the local collection
3. Integrates with Lidarr to search for and download requested songs
4. Provides a unified, user-friendly interface for all music-related activities
5. Keeps all data processing local to preserve user privacy

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: Tech-savvy music enthusiasts
- Demographic: Adults aged 25-45 with technical knowledge
- Current behaviors: Already running self-hosted services (Ollama, Navidrome, Lidarr)
- Needs: Better music discovery, unified interface, privacy preservation
- Goals: Effortless music discovery and management without external dependencies

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Business Objectives
- Create a fully functional interface within 4 weeks
- Achieve seamless integration with all three services
- Maintain 99% uptime for local network access
- Receive positive feedback from initial user testing

### User Success Metrics
- Time to discover and play a recommended song < 30 seconds
- Success rate of song downloads through Lidarr > 95%
- User satisfaction rating > 4/5 stars

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Application response time < 2 seconds
- Successful API calls to all services > 99%
- User retention rate > 80% after first week

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)
- **Music playback interface:** Connect to Navidrome and play music through a web interface
- **AI recommendations:** Interface with Ollama to get music recommendations
- **Download requests:** Send song requests to Lidarr for downloading
- **User authentication:** Secure access to the application
- **Basic UI:** Clean, functional interface for all core features

### Out of Scope for MVP
- Advanced playlist creation and management
- Social features or sharing capabilities
- Mobile app version
- Offline mode
- Advanced analytics or listening history visualization

### MVP Success Criteria
The MVP is successful when users can:
1. Access their music library through the interface
2. Receive AI-generated recommendations
3. Request downloads that are processed by Lidarr
4. All functions work reliably on the local network

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features
- Advanced playlist creation with AI assistance
- Listening history and analytics
- Mobile-responsive design
- Offline mode for downloaded content
- Integration with additional music services

### Long-term Vision
A comprehensive personal music assistant that learns user preferences, automatically manages the music library, and provides a seamless listening experience across all devices while maintaining complete privacy.

### Expansion Opportunities
- Integration with other self-hosted services (e.g., audiobook services)
- Voice control capabilities
- Multi-user support with individual preferences
- Smart home integration

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements
- **Target Platforms:** Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Browser/OS Support:** Modern browsers on Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Performance Requirements:** Fast loading times, smooth playback

### Technology Preferences
- **Frontend:** React.js or Vue.js for a responsive interface
- **Backend:** Node.js or Python (Flask/FastAPI) for API integrations
- **Database:** SQLite for local storage of user preferences and settings
- **Hosting/Infrastructure:** Docker container for easy deployment

### Architecture Considerations
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo with separate frontend and backend directories
- **Service Architecture:** RESTful APIs for communication between services
- **Integration Requirements:** APIs for Ollama, Navidrome, and Lidarr
- **Security/Compliance:** HTTPS for local access, secure storage of API keys

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- **Budget:** Limited to free/open-source technologies
- **Timeline:** 4 weeks for MVP development
- **Resources:** Single developer
- **Technical:** All services must be accessible on the local network

### Key Assumptions
- Users have Ollama, Navidrome, and Lidarr already running on their LAN
- Users have technical knowledge to configure API connections
- Network connectivity between services is stable
- Services have appropriate API endpoints for integration

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
- **API compatibility:** Risk that service APIs may change or be incompatible
- **Performance:** Risk of slow recommendations if Ollama models are large
- **Security:** Risk of exposing local services if not properly secured
- **User adoption:** Risk that the interface may be too complex for average users

### Open Questions
- What specific Ollama models will be used for recommendations?
- What are the API endpoints and authentication methods for each service?
- How should user preferences be stored and managed?
- What level of customization do users need for recommendations?

### Areas Needing Further Research
- Detailed API documentation for Ollama, Navidrome, and Lidarr
- Best practices for securing local service integrations
- Optimal Ollama model selection for music recommendations
- User interface design for music applications

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Research API documentation for all three services
2. Set up development environment with access to local services
3. Create project repository and basic structure
4. Begin UI/UX design
