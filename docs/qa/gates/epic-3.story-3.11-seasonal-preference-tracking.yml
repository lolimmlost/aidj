# Advisory notes
notes: |
  This implementation demonstrates excellent software engineering practices with clean architecture,
  type safety, and thoughtful design. The statistical approach to confidence scoring and privacy
  controls show maturity. However, the failing unit tests and missing E2E coverage create risk.

  RECOMMENDATION: Address the test failures before merging to ensure production stability. The team
  has final authority on quality bar - if timeline is critical, consider a WAIVED gate with PO
  approval, but strongly recommend fixing tests first to prevent regression bugs.

  POSITIVE: All 6 acceptance criteria are functionally implemented. Temporal utilities have 100%
  test coverage (15/15 passing). Database schema is well-designed with appropriate indexes.
