**Recommendation**: 
- Define specific load testing requirements (concurrent users, requests per second)
- Specify scalability testing criteria
- Add performance testing acceptance criteria for different user scenarios

### 2. Error Handling Specifications
**Issue**: Lack of specific error handling acceptance criteria for non-happy path scenarios.
**Impact**: Risk of inconsistent error handling and poor user experience during failures.
**Recommendation**:
- Add detailed error handling acceptance criteria to each user story
- Define specific error logging requirements
- Specify error recovery procedures and user notifications

**Issue**: Missing detailed security testing requirements and procedures.
**Impact**: Risk of security vulnerabilities in service integrations and data handling.
**Recommendation**:
- Add security testing requirements for each service integration
- Define penetration testing scope and acceptance criteria
- Specify vulnerability assessment procedures
- Add compliance verification criteria

### 4. Accessibility Testing Requirements
**Issue**: Limited accessibility testing criteria beyond WCAG AA mention.
**Impact**: Risk of accessibility issues affecting users with disabilities.
**Recommendation**:
- Add specific accessibility testing acceptance criteria
- Define WCAG AA compliance verification procedures
- Specify accessibility testing tools and methodologies

### 5. Usability Testing Scope
**Issue**: Limited usability testing requirements beyond general UX goals.
**Impact**: Risk of suboptimal user experience and adoption challenges.
**Recommendation**:
- Add usability testing requirements and acceptance criteria
- Define usability testing methodologies
- Specify user experience evaluation criteria

### 6. Cross-Browser Testing Requirements
**Issue**: No specific cross-browser testing requirements or compatibility criteria.
**Impact**: Risk of inconsistent behavior across supported browsers.
**Recommendation**:
- Define specific cross-browser testing requirements
- Add browser compatibility acceptance criteria
- Specify testing procedures for each supported browser

### 7. Integration Testing Scope
**Issue**: Limited explicit integration testing requirements for service interactions.
**Impact**: Risk of integration failures between Ollama, Navidrome, and Lidarr services.
**Recommendation**:
- Add explicit integration testing requirements for service interactions
- Define API contract testing approaches
- Specify integration testing acceptance criteria

### 8. Monitoring and Observability Requirements
**Issue**: Limited observability and monitoring requirements.
**Impact**: Risk of difficulty in diagnosing issues in production environments.
**Recommendation**:
- Define application monitoring requirements
- Add logging and observability acceptance criteria
- Specify monitoring tools and methodologies

### 9. Test Data Management
**Issue**: No explicit test data management strategies.
**Impact**: Risk of inconsistent test data affecting test reliability.
**Recommendation**:
- Add test data management strategies
- Define test data creation and maintenance procedures
- Specify data privacy and security requirements for test data

### 10. Acceptance Criteria Coverage
**Issue**: Most user stories only include happy path acceptance criteria.
**Impact**: Risk of inadequate testing for edge cases and error scenarios.
**Recommendation**:
- Add non-happy path acceptance criteria to user stories
