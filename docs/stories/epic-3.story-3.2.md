# Epic 3 Story 3.2: Recommendation Display and Interaction

As a user,
I want to see AI-generated music recommendations,
so that I can discover new music based on my preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] 1. Create recommendation display section on the main dashboard using CSS variables for theme implementation
- [x] 2. Implement different recommendation types (similar artists, mood-based, etc.) with mobile-specific performance optimizations
- [x] 3. Allow users to provide feedback on recommendations (thumbs up/down) with encrypted storage
- [x] 4. Create detailed recommendation view with explanations using file-based routing
- [x] 5. Implement functionality to add recommended songs to play queue with lazy loading
- [x] 6. Display recommendation generation timestamp with service connection timeout specifications

## Tasks
- [x] Implement dashboard recommendations section in src/routes/dashboard/index.tsx
- [x] Update ollama service for structured responses in src/lib/services/ollama.ts
- [x] Create detailed view in src/routes/dashboard/recommendations/[id].tsx
- [x] Add feedback encryption with XOR in localStorage
- [x] Integrate audio store for queue add
- [x] Add timestamp and timeout display
