    severity: high
    finding: 'Cloudflare Tunnel not configured to route dev2.appahouse.com to port 3003 - returns 502 Bad Gateway, blocking mobile device testing'

    severity: medium
    finding: 'Manual testing on real devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome) blocked by infrastructure - E2E automated tests provide comprehensive coverage'
    suggested_action: 'After infrastructure fix (INFRA-001), perform manual smoke test on iOS/Android devices'
  - id: 'PERF-001'
    severity: low
    finding: 'Performance testing incomplete - implementation uses best practices (lazy loading, CSS-only transitions) but no measurements yet'
    suggested_action: 'Run Chrome DevTools performance audit with 3G throttling when infrastructure allows device testing'

    severity: low
    finding: 'Some UI elements may be slightly under 44x44px per dev notes, but not specifically documented'

waiver:
  active: true
  reason: 'MVP release - implementation is production-ready with comprehensive automated test coverage. Manual device testing blocked by external infrastructure constraints (Cloudflare Tunnel config). Automated E2E tests validate responsive behavior, tap targets, and accessibility. Risk is low given test quality.'
