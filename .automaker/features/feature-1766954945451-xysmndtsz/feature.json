  "description": "Implement Collaborative Playlist Creation with Real-Time Voting System\n\nBuild a comprehensive collaborative playlist feature that enables users to create shared playlists, invite collaborators, and collectively curate music through a voting-based suggestion system.\n\nRequirements:\n\n**Playlist Sharing & Collaboration**\n- Create sharable playlists with configurable privacy settings (public, private, invite-only)\n- Implement invitation system to add friends/users as collaborators\n- Define role-based permissions (owner, editor, viewer) with different access levels\n- Display list of current collaborators with their roles on playlist view\n- Allow playlist owner to remove collaborators or transfer ownership\n\n**Song Suggestion System**\n- Enable collaborators to suggest songs for addition to the playlist\n- Create a suggestions queue/section separate from the main playlist\n- Display suggested songs with metadata (title, artist, album, duration)\n- Show who suggested each song and when\n- Allow users to withdraw their own suggestions\n\n**Voting Mechanism**\n- Implement upvote/downvote functionality for each suggested song\n- Display vote counts and net score for each suggestion\n- Prevent duplicate voting (one vote per user per song)\n- Allow users to change their vote\n- Sort suggestions by vote score, timestamp, or other criteria\n\n**Real-Time Synchronization**\n- Update suggestions and votes in real-time for all active collaborators\n- Broadcast playlist changes (additions, removals, reordering) to all viewers\n- Handle conflict resolution for simultaneous actions\n- Show presence indicators for currently active collaborators\n\n**Approval & Addition Workflow**\n- Define threshold or rules for automatic song approval (e.g., +3 votes, owner approval)\n- Allow playlist owner to manually approve/reject suggestions regardless of votes\n- Automatically add approved songs to the playlist\n- Notify collaborators when songs are added or rejected\n- Archive or remove rejected suggestions\n\n**Edge Cases & Constraints**\n- Handle deleted/unavailable songs in suggestions\n- Set limits on suggestion queue size per user or total\n- Manage permissions when users leave or are removed from collaboration\n- Handle playlist deletion and its impact on collaborators\n- Validate song availability across different regions/platforms\n\n**Technical Considerations**\n- Choose real-time communication protocol (WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, polling)\n- Design database schema for playlists, collaborators, suggestions, and votes\n- Implement efficient queries for vote aggregation and ranking\n- Add appropriate indexes for performance\n- Consider caching strategy for frequently accessed playlist data\n\n**User Experience**\n- Provide clear visual distinction between main playlist and suggestions queue\n- Show loading states during real-time updates\n- Display notifications for new suggestions, votes, and approvals\n- Include undo functionality for accidental actions\n- Make voting interface intuitive and responsive",
