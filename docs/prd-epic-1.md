# Music Recommendation and Download Interface Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

## Epic Goal

Establish the foundational project structure, implement user authentication, and create the basic configuration system for connecting to local services. This epic will deliver a working application shell with secure access and the ability to configure connections to Ollama, Navidrome, and Lidarr services.

Root Source Folder Convention
- All frontend and backend source code for Epic 1 MUST reside under the /src directory at repository root. Import paths should be resolved relative to /src. Do not place business logic or components outside /src unless explicitly allowed for tooling or configuration.
- Database interactions will use Drizzle ORM with SQLite for local storage of user preferences and settings
- Docker containerization will include explicit networking configuration

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Basic Structure

As a developer,
I want to set up the project with a monorepo structure containing frontend and backend components,
so that I can begin implementing the application features.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Create project repository with appropriate directory structure
2. Set up package.json with project metadata and dependencies
3. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality standards
4. Set up basic Git configuration with initial commit
5. Create README with project description and setup instructions

## Story 1.2: User Authentication System

As a user,
I want to securely log in to the application,
so that my preferences and settings are protected.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Implement user registration functionality with secure password storage
2. Create login interface with username and password fields
3. Implement session management with secure tokens
4. Add logout functionality
5. Create protected routes that require authentication
6. Implement proper error handling for authentication failures

## Story 1.3: Service Configuration Interface

As a user,
I want to configure connections to my local Ollama, Navidrome, and Lidarr services,
so that the application can communicate with these services.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Create configuration screen with fields for service URLs and credentials
2. Implement form validation for configuration inputs
3. Store configuration securely in local storage or database
4. Provide test connection functionality for each service
5. Display connection status indicators for each service
6. Implement proper error handling for configuration issues

## Story 1.4: Local Development Environment Setup

As a developer,
I want a reproducible local dev environment (containers, scripts) so that new contributors can start quickly.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Docker/compose configuration with explicit networking configuration
2. Local environment variables documented and loaded securely
3. npm/yarn install and startup scripts work out-of-the-box
4. Developer README includes setup and run instructions
5. Linting and formatting run on pre-commit or CI

Points: 3

## Story 1.5: Basic CI/CD Pipeline

As a development team, we want automated builds and basic tests on push to main, so that quality gates are enforced.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Basic CI workflow (build, lint, unit tests)
2. Cache dependencies to speed up builds
3. Reports and artifacts accessible from CI
4. Documentation of CI/CD workflow in repo

Points: 3

## Story 1.6: Secrets Management & Security Baseline

As a security-conscious team, we want a baseline for secrets management to protect credentials and API keys.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Secrets stored securely (env vars, vault, or encrypted storage)
2. Sensitive data redacted from logs and error messages
3. Create baseline security checklist and enforce in CI

Points: 3
