This context is provided to help you understand the background and requirements for this sub-task. Do not re-implement the parent task - focus only on the new sub-task described below.\n\n### I appreciate the detailed setup, but I notice you haven't provided the actual feature description for me to create a title for. \n\nCould you please share the **feature description** that you'd like me to generate a title for? \n\nFor example, it might look something like:\n- \"Fix playlist items that appear squished in the UI\"\n- \"Expand search bar width for better usability\"\n- \"Optimize responsive layout for mobile views\"\n\nOnce you provide the feature description, I'll generate a concise 5-10 word title for it immediately.\n\n**Description:** Let me help you enhance this task description. First, I need to see the images you mentioned to provide a more accurate specification.\n\nCould you please provide:\n1. Image 1 showing the issue with the playlist items being squished\n2. Any other relevant screenshots showing the search bar width issue\n\nOnce I can see the visual context, I'll create a clear, actionable task description that addresses both UI issues precisely.\n\n---\n\n## Task Description\n\nthe suggest aomg search issue is fixed but the playlist still gets squished when clicking the collaborate button and the collaborate screen slides in\n",
