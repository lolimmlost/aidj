  "description": "Build Personalized Music Discovery Feed with Time-Based Recommendations\n\nCreate an intelligent music discovery system that delivers personalized recommendations tailored to user listening patterns and time-of-day preferences, with smart notifications to maximize engagement.\n\nCore Features:\n- Display a dynamic feed of music recommendations (playlists, artists, songs)\n- Analyze user listening history to identify time-based patterns (morning commute, workout hours, evening wind-down, etc.)\n- Personalize recommendations based on genre preferences, mood, and historical engagement\n- Implement smart notification system that suggests content at optimal times for each user\n- Track and learn from user interactions (plays, skips, saves) to refine recommendations\n\nTechnical Requirements:\n- Design data model for storing user listening history with timestamps\n- Build recommendation algorithm that factors in:\n  * Time of day\n  * Day of week patterns\n  * Genre/artist preferences\n  * Listening context (workout, focus, relaxation)\n- Create feed UI component that displays recommendations with relevant metadata\n- Implement notification scheduling system that:\n  * Calculates optimal notification times per user\n  * Respects user notification preferences and quiet hours\n  * Includes A/B testing capability for timing optimization\n- Set up background jobs for generating daily recommendation batches\n- Add analytics tracking for recommendation quality metrics\n\nUser Experience Considerations:\n- Allow users to customize notification frequency and timing\n- Provide clear value in each notification (e.g., \"New workout playlist for your morning routine\")\n- Enable easy feedback mechanisms (like/dislike, not interested)\n- Ensure graceful degradation for new users with limited history\n- Display explanations for why content is recommended\n- Support offline access to recommended content\n\nSuccess Metrics:\n- Track recommendation click-through rate\n- Measure notification open and engagement rates\n- Monitor time spent with recommended content\n- Calculate recommendation accuracy based on user interactions\n- Measure user retention and discovery feature adoption\n\nEdge Cases to Handle:\n- New users with no listening history\n- Users with irregular schedules\n- Privacy considerations for data collection and storage\n- Handling users who disable notifications\n- Graceful fallback when recommendation engine fails",
