# Routing Structure Implementation

Based on the architecture document, the following routing structure should be implemented:

## Route Organization
```
routes/
├── __root.tsx            # Root layout
├── index.tsx             # Dashboard
├── login.tsx             # Login page
├── library/
│   ├── index.tsx         # Library overview
│   ├── artists.tsx       # Artists list
│   ├── albums.tsx        # Albums list
│   └── songs.tsx         # Songs list
├── recommendations/
│   ├── index.tsx         # Recommendations feed
│   └── [id].tsx          # Recommendation detail
├── downloads/
│   ├── index.tsx         # Download queue
│   └── history.tsx       # Download history
└── settings/
    ├── index.tsx         # Settings overview
    ├── profile.tsx       # User profile
    └── services.tsx      # Service configuration
```

## Implementation Notes

1. The existing authentication routes in `src/routes/(auth)/` should be retained
2. The dashboard route in `src/routes/dashboard/` should be updated to serve as the main application interface
3. New routes should be created for library, recommendations, downloads, and settings
4. Each route should implement proper authentication checks
5. The root route should redirect authenticated users to the dashboard
