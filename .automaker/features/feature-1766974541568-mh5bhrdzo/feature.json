  "description": "## Parent Task Context (Already Completed)\n\n> **Note:** The following parent task has already been completed. This context is provided to help you understand the background and requirements for this sub-task. Do not re-implement the parent task - focus only on the new sub-task described below.\n\n### Task (feature-)\n\n**Description:** Build Personalized Music Discovery Feed with Time-Based Recommendations\n\nCreate an intelligent music discovery system that delivers personalized recommendations tailored to user listening patterns and time-of-day preferences, with smart notifications to maximize engagement.\n\nCore Features:\n- Display a dynamic feed of music recommendations (playlists, artists, songs)\n- Analyze user listening history to identify time-based patterns (morning commute, workout hours, evening wind-down, etc.)\n- Personalize recommendations based on genre preferences, mood, and historical engagement\n- Implement smart notification system that suggests content at optimal times for each user\n- Track and learn from user interactions (plays, skips, saves) to refine recommendations\n\nTechnical Requirements:\n- Design data model for storing user listening history with timestamps\n- Build recommendation algorithm that factors in:\n  * Time of day\n  * Day of week patterns\n  * Genre/artist preferences\n  * Listening context (workout, focus, relaxation)\n- Create feed UI component that displays recommendations with relevant metadata\n- Implement notification scheduling system that:\n  * Calculates optimal notification times per user\n  * Respects user notification preferences and quiet hours\n  * Includes A/B testing capability for timing optimization\n- Set up background jobs for generating daily recommendation batches\n- Add analytics tracking for recommendation quality metrics\n\nUser Experience Considerations:\n- Allow users to customize notification frequency and timing\n- Provide clear value in each notification (e.g., \"New workout playlist for your morning routine\")\n- Enable easy feedback mechanisms (like/dislike, not interested)\n- Ensure graceful degradation for new users with limited history\n- Display explanations for why content is recommended\n- Support offline access to recommended content\n\nSuccess Metrics:\n- Track recommendation click-through rate\n- Measure notification open and engagement rates\n- Monitor time spent with recommended content\n- Calculate recommendation accuracy based on user interactions\n- Measure user retention and discovery feature adoption\n\nEdge Cases to Handle:\n- New users with no listening history\n- Users with irregular schedules\n- Privacy considerations for data collection and storage\n- Handling users who disable notifications\n- Graceful fallback when recommendation engine fails\n\n---\n\n## Task Description\n\nwhat ui should i be seeing from this?",
  "title": "I need to clarify what you're asking. Based on your message, it seems like you're asking about the **user interface design** for this music discovery feature, rather than asking me to generate a title.\n\nHowever, my role is to generate a concise title for the feature. Let me do that first:\n\n**Personalized Music Discovery Feed with Time-Based Recommendations**\n\n---\n\nIf you're actually asking **\"What UI should I be seeing from this?\"** — that's a great question about the interface design! Here's what users should see:\n\n### Main Feed UI\n- **Recommendation cards** displayed vertically (similar to Spotify/Apple Music discovery)\n- Each card showing: playlist/artist artwork, title, brief description, \"why this was recommended\" tag\n- Quick action buttons: Play, Save, Like/Dislike, More options\n\n### Notification UI\n- **Smart push notifications** appearing at optimal times with personalized context\n- Example: \"New morning workout playlist ready for your commute\"\n- Tappable notifications that navigate to the recommended content\n\n### Settings/Preferences UI\n- Toggle for notifications on/off\n- Customize notification frequency (daily, 3x/week, etc.)\n- Set quiet hours (e.g., 10 PM - 8 AM)\n- Time-of-day preference settings (morning, workout, focus, evening, night)\n\n### Analytics/Insights UI (optional)\n- Show why recommendations are personalized (\"Based on your 2 AM jazz sessions\")\n- Display your listening patterns by time of day\n- View recommendation engagement stats\n\nWould you like me to **generate a title for a specific UI component** instead, or do you need help designing the interface in more detail?",
