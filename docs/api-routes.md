# API Routes Implementation

Based on the architecture document, the following API routes need to be implemented:

## Authentication Routes
- POST /api/auth/login - User login
- POST /api/auth/logout - User logout

## Recommendation Routes
- GET /api/recommendations - Get music recommendations

## Library Routes
- GET /api/library/artists - Get list of artists
- GET /api/library/albums - Get list of albums
- GET /api/library/songs - Get list of songs

## Download Routes
- GET /api/downloads - Get download requests
- POST /api/downloads - Create download request
- GET /api/downloads/{id} - Get download request status

## Implementation Notes

These routes should be implemented as TanStack Start API routes in the `src/routes/api/` directory. Each route should:

1. Use proper authentication middleware
2. Validate input parameters
3. Handle errors appropriately
4. Return data in the format specified in the OpenAPI specification
5. Integrate with the external services (Ollama, Navidrome, Lidarr)
