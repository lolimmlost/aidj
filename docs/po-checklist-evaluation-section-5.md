# PO Master Validation Checklist - Section 5: User/Agent Responsibility Evaluation

## 5.1 User Actions

### Evaluation
- [x] User responsibilities limited to human-only tasks
  - Users are responsible for setting up and running Ollama, Navidrome, and Lidarr on their LAN
  - Users need to provide API keys and service URLs for configuration
  - These are appropriately assigned as user responsibilities since they require human action

- [x] Account creation on external services assigned to users
  - Users are expected to have already created accounts and set up Ollama, Navidrome, and Lidarr
  - Account creation is appropriately assigned to users as they are the service owners

- [x] Purchasing or payment actions assigned to users
  - Not applicable for this project as it uses free/open-source technologies
  - The project brief explicitly states the budget is limited to free/open-source technologies

- [x] Credential provision appropriately assigned to users
  - Users are responsible for providing API keys and service URLs for configuration
  - This is appropriately assigned to users as they control these credentials
  - The implementation tasks document mentions updating .env.example with required environment variables

## 5.2 Developer Agent Actions

### Evaluation
- [x] All code-related tasks assigned to developer agents
  - All implementation tasks in the implementation-tasks.md document are assigned to developers
  - Code-related tasks include database schema updates, API route implementation, route structure implementation, service integration, and UI component development

- [x] Automated processes identified as agent responsibilities
  - Automated processes like database migrations, build processes, and deployment are handled by developer agents
  - The package.json includes scripts for automated processes like "db push", "dev", "build", and "start"

- [x] Configuration management properly assigned
  - Configuration management is properly assigned to developer agents
  - The implementation tasks document includes a task for updating environment configuration
  - Developers are responsible for setting up the development environment and managing configuration files

- [x] Testing and validation assigned to appropriate agents
  - Testing and validation are assigned to developer agents
  - The PRD technical assumptions specify "Unit + Integration testing"
  - Although testing frameworks are not yet included in package.json, this would be a developer responsibility to implement

## Summary

Section 5: User/Agent Responsibility - PASSED

All checklist items for user/agent responsibility have been satisfied. User responsibilities are appropriately limited to human-only tasks such as setting up external services and providing credentials. All code-related tasks, automated processes, configuration management, and testing are properly assigned to developer agents. The division of responsibilities is clear and appropriate for this project.
