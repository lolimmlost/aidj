# PO Master Validation Checklist - Section 8: MVP Scope Alignment Evaluation

## 8.1 Core Goals Alignment

### Evaluation
- [x] All core goals from PRD are addressed
  - The PRD clearly defines six core goals that align with the project brief:
    1. Create a unified web interface for music discovery, streaming, and downloading using local self-hosted services
    2. Integrate with Ollama for privacy-focused AI music recommendations
    3. Enable seamless music streaming through Navidrome integration
    4. Facilitate music downloads through Lidarr integration
    5. Provide an intuitive user experience for managing personal music collections
    6. Maintain all data processing local to preserve user privacy
  - All of these goals are addressed through the five epics in the PRD

- [x] Features directly support MVP goals
  - Epic 1 (Foundation & Core Infrastructure) supports goals 1 and 5 by establishing the unified interface and configuration system
  - Epic 2 (Music Library Integration) supports goals 1 and 3 by enabling music streaming through Navidrome
  - Epic 3 (AI Recommendations Engine) supports goals 1 and 2 by integrating with Ollama for recommendations
  - Epic 4 (Download Management) supports goals 1 and 4 by enabling downloads through Lidarr
  - Epic 5 (Unified User Experience) supports goals 1, 5, and 6 by creating a cohesive interface with consistent design

- [x] No extraneous features beyond MVP scope
  - All features in the five epics directly support the core goals
  - The MVP scope in the project brief explicitly includes music playback interface, AI recommendations, download requests, user authentication, and basic UI
  - All of these are covered in Epics 1-4, with Epic 5 enhancing the user experience

- [x] Critical features prioritized appropriately
  - Critical features like authentication, service configuration, music library browsing, and playback are prioritized in Epic 1 and 2
  - Recommendations and download management are prioritized in Epic 3 and 4
  - UI polish and responsive design are addressed in Epic 5 after core functionality is established

- [N/A] [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] Enhancement complexity justified
  - Not applicable for greenfield project

## 8.2 User Journey Completeness

### Evaluation
- [x] All critical user journeys fully implemented
  - The critical user journeys are fully covered:
    1. User authentication and access to the application
    2. Configuration of service connections (Ollama, Navidrome, Lidarr)
    3. Browsing and searching the music library
    4. Playing music from the library
    5. Receiving and interacting with AI recommendations
    6. Searching for and requesting music downloads
    7. Monitoring download status
  - Each journey is supported by specific user stories with clear acceptance criteria

- [x] Edge cases and error scenarios addressed
  - Error handling is addressed in the acceptance criteria for most stories:
    - Authentication failures (Epic 1, Story 1.2)
    - Configuration issues (Epic 1, Story 1.3)
    - API failures for Navidrome (Epic 2, Story 2.1)
    - API failures for Ollama (Epic 3, Story 3.1)
    - API failures for Lidarr (Epic 4, Story 4.1)
    - Duplicate request detection (Epic 4, Story 4.2)

- [x] User experience considerations included
  - User experience considerations are included throughout:
    - Simple configuration workflow for connecting to local services
    - Search and discovery focused interface with recommendation highlights
    - Streamlined workflow from music discovery to playback or download
    - Unified dashboard for monitoring music library and download status

- [x] [[UI/UX ONLY]] Accessibility requirements incorporated
  - Accessibility requirements are incorporated with WCAG AA compliance specified in the PRD
  - The front-end specification includes detailed accessibility requirements

- [N/A] [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] Existing workflows preserved or improved
  - Not applicable for greenfield project

## 8.3 Technical Requirements

### Evaluation
- [x] All technical constraints from PRD addressed
  - Technical constraints from the PRD are addressed:
    - Monorepo repository structure
    - Monolith within a Monorepo service architecture
    - Unit + Integration testing requirements
    - Use of TanStack Start, Better Auth, Drizzle ORM, and SQLite
    - Docker containerization
    - File-based routing system
    - Error handling and logging
    - Environment variables for configuration
    - Responsive design for desktop and mobile
    - API routes for service integrations

- [x] Non-functional requirements incorporated
  - Non-functional requirements from the PRD are incorporated:
    - HTTPS communication with local services (NFR1)
    - Secure storage of credentials and API keys (NFR2)
    - 2-second response time (NFR3)
    - 99% availability when local services are operational (NFR4)
    - Support for modern web browsers (NFR5)
    - Local data processing (NFR6)
    - Graceful API error handling (NFR7)
    - Input validation (NFR8)

- [x] Architecture decisions align with constraints
