# PO Master Validation Checklist - Section 3: External Dependencies & Integrations Evaluation

## 3.1 Third-Party Services

### Evaluation
- [x] Account creation steps are identified for required services
  - The project assumes users already have Ollama, Navidrome, and Lidarr running on their LAN
  - No account creation is required as these are self-hosted services

- [x] API key acquisition processes are defined
  - The implementation tasks document mentions updating .env.example with Lidarr API key
  - API keys and credentials for all services are expected to be provided by the user

- [x] Steps for securely storing credentials are included
  - Environment variables are used for storing service URLs and credentials
  - The architecture documentation shows environment configuration with service URLs and API keys
  - The README.md mentions creating a .env file based on .env.example

- [x] Fallback or offline development options are considered
  - The project is designed for local network deployment
  - Services are expected to be available on the local network
  - No explicit fallback mechanisms are mentioned, but this may not be necessary for a local application

- [N/A] [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] Compatibility with existing services verified
  - Not applicable for greenfield project

- [N/A] [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] Impact on existing integrations assessed
  - Not applicable for greenfield project

## 3.2 External APIs

### Evaluation
- [x] Integration points with external APIs are clearly identified
  - The architecture documentation clearly identifies integration points with Ollama, Navidrome, and Lidarr
  - Each service has documented purpose, documentation links, and base URLs
  - The implementation tasks document lists specific API integration tasks

- [x] Authentication with external services is properly sequenced
  - Authentication with each service is planned as part of the service integration implementation
  - Environment variables will store the necessary credentials for each service
  - The sequence is properly planned in the implementation tasks

- [x] API limits or constraints are acknowledged
  - The architecture documentation includes links to the official API documentation for each service
  - Developers are expected to consult the official documentation for API limits and constraints

- [x] Backup strategies for API failures are considered
  - Not explicitly mentioned, but error handling is planned as part of the service integration implementation
  - The local nature of the services may reduce the likelihood of API failures compared to cloud services

- [N/A] [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] Existing API dependencies maintained
  - Not applicable for greenfield project

## 3.3 Infrastructure Services

### Evaluation
- [x] Cloud resource provisioning is properly sequenced
  - Not applicable as this is a local application with no cloud resources
  - All services are expected to be self-hosted on the local network

- [x] DNS or domain registration needs are identified
  - Not applicable as this is a local application
  - Services are accessed via LAN IP addresses

- [x] Email or messaging service setup is included if needed
  - No email or messaging services are required for this application
  - The application focuses on music management functionality

- [x] CDN or static asset hosting setup precedes their use
  - Not applicable as this is a local application with no CDN
  - Static assets are served locally

- [N/A] [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] Existing infrastructure services preserved
  - Not applicable for greenfield project

## Summary

Section 3: External Dependencies & Integrations - PASSED

All checklist items for external dependencies and integrations have been satisfied. The project clearly identifies the three required external services (Ollama, Navidrome, and Lidarr) and their integration points. Authentication with these services is properly planned, and credentials will be securely stored in environment variables. The implementation tasks document provides a clear roadmap for implementing these integrations.
