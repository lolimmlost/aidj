nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Authentication enforced on all endpoints. No sensitive data exposure. Graceful error handling without information leakage."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "5s timeout compliance verified. Library analysis completes within spec. Genre scoring algorithm optimized (O(n*m) where n=rec genres, m=lib genres)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with fallback to basic recommendations. Timeout handling tested. Graceful degradation when metadata missing."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear separation of concerns. Well-documented functions. Levenshtein distance implementation for fuzzy matching. Type-safe interfaces."

refactoring_performed:
  - file: "src/lib/services/genre-matcher.ts:106-140"
    issue: "Genre scoring algorithm incorrectly averaged scores across all recommendation genres instead of finding best match"
    fix: "Changed algorithm to return best single match score (weighted by library genre distribution)"
    impact: "Critical fix - improved matching accuracy from ~0.20 to ~0.34-0.40 for strong matches"
    why: "Previous algorithm penalized recommendations with multiple genres by averaging all scores"
    test_validation: "All 15 genre-matcher tests now pass with correct score expectations"

  - file: "src/lib/db/schema/library-profiles.schema.ts:31-40"
    issue: "Deprecated pgTable syntax using object for indexes instead of array"
    fix: "Changed index definition from object notation to array notation"
    impact: "Eliminates deprecation warning, ensures forward compatibility with Drizzle ORM updates"
    why: "Drizzle ORM is migrating to array-based index definitions"
    test_validation: "Schema compiles without deprecation warnings"

  - file: "src/lib/services/__tests__/library-profile.test.ts:79,114,148,272"
    issue: "Type safety violations using 'as any' for mock type casting"
    fix: "Changed to 'as unknown as ReturnType<typeof mockDb.update>' for safer type assertion"
    impact: "Improved type safety without breaking test mocking functionality"
    why: "Type safety is important even in test code to catch refactoring issues"
    test_validation: "All 9 library-profile tests pass with improved type safety"
