# Music Recommendation and Download Interface UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for the Music Recommendation and Download Interface's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas
- **Tech-Savvy Music Enthusiast:** Users who run self-hosted services (Ollama, Navidrome, Lidarr) and want a unified interface to manage their music collection. They value privacy, customization, and technical control over their media.
- **Music Collector:** Users with extensive music libraries who want to easily discover new music, manage their collection, and download new additions. They prioritize organization and efficiency.
- **Privacy-Conscious Listener:** Users who prefer to keep their music data local and avoid external services. They value applications that respect their privacy and data ownership.

#### Usability Goals
- Ease of learning: New users can configure service connections and play music within 5 minutes
- Efficiency of use: Power users can quickly navigate between recommendations, library browsing, and download management
- Error prevention: Clear validation and feedback for service connection issues
- Memorability: Infrequent users can return without relearning core workflows
- Accessibility: Users with disabilities can fully access all functionality

#### Design Principles
1. **Simplicity over complexity** - Prioritize clear, straightforward workflows over feature density
2. **Consistent music experience** - Use familiar patterns from popular music applications
3. **Immediate feedback** - Every action related to service connections or music playback should have a clear, immediate response
4. **Progressive disclosure** - Show advanced configuration options only when needed
5. **Accessible by default** - Design for all users from the start with proper contrast and keyboard navigation

    E --> E2[Download History]
    F --> F1[Service Configuration]
    F --> F2[User Profile]
    F --> F3[Preferences]
```

### Navigation Structure
**Primary Navigation:** Bottom navigation bar on mobile, left sidebar on desktop with the following items:
- Dashboard (Home)
- Library
- Recommendations
- Downloads
- Settings

**Secondary Navigation:** Contextual navigation within each section (e.g., sub-tabs for different library views)

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** Breadcrumb navigation for hierarchical views (e.g., Artists > Artist Name > Album Name > Song)

## User Flows

### Music Playback Flow
**User Goal:** Find and play a song from the music library

**Entry Points:** 
- Library browsing (Artists, Albums, Songs)
- Search results
- Recommendation feed
- Playlist

**Success Criteria:** User can play a song with minimal steps and clear feedback

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User selects song] --> B[Check Navidrome connection]
    B --> C{Connected?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Load song metadata]
    C -->|No| E[Show connection error]
    D --> F[Load album artwork]
    F --> G[Start streaming]
    G --> H[Display now playing screen]
    E --> I[Show configuration option]
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- Navidrome service is unreachable
- Song file is not available in Navidrome
- User has insufficient permissions
- Network connectivity issues

**Notes:** The playback experience should be seamless with minimal loading time. Visual feedback should indicate when a song is buffering.

### Recommendation Discovery Flow
**User Goal:** Discover new music through AI recommendations

**Entry Points:** 
- Dashboard recommendation feed
- Dedicated recommendations section
- After playing a song

**Success Criteria:** User can easily browse recommendations and either play or download suggested music

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User views recommendations] --> B[Fetch from Ollama]
    B --> C{Recommendations available?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Display recommendations]
    C -->|No| E[Show empty state]
    D --> F[User selects recommendation]
    F --> G{Action?}
    G -->|Play| H[Start playback]
    G -->|Download| I[Add to Lidarr]
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- Ollama service is unreachable
- No recommendations generated
- User has not configured Ollama connection
- Recommendation includes music not in library

**Notes:** Recommendations should be presented in an engaging visual format with album artwork. Users should be able to provide feedback on recommendations.

### Download Request Flow
**User Goal:** Request a new song or album for download through Lidarr

**Entry Points:** 
- Search interface
- Recommendation feed
- Album/Song detail pages

**Success Criteria:** User can search for music and successfully submit a download request to Lidarr

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User searches for music] --> B[Query Lidarr]
    B --> C{Results found?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Display search results]
    C -->|No| E[Show no results]
    D --> F[User selects item]
    F --> G[Add to download queue]
    G --> H{Lidarr accepts request?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Show success message]
    H -->|No| J[Show error message]
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- Lidarr service is unreachable
- Search returns no results
- User has not configured Lidarr connection
- Item is already in download queue
- Lidarr rejects the request (e.g., quality profile mismatch)

**Notes:** The search interface should be responsive and provide clear feedback on the status of download requests.

- Multi-column grid on tablet and desktop
- Sidebar navigation on desktop, bottom navigation on mobile

**Navigation Changes:** 
- Hamburger menu on mobile
- Persistent sidebar on desktop
- Contextual navigation in header

**Content Priority:** 
- Primary content always visible
- Secondary content accessible via tabs or accordions on mobile
- Full content visible on larger screens

**Interaction Changes:** 
- Touch-friendly controls on mobile
- Hover states on desktop
- Swipe gestures for navigation on mobile

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles
Animations should be subtle, purposeful, and enhance the user experience without causing distraction. Use easing functions that feel natural and responsive.

### Key Animations
- **Page Transitions:** Slide transitions between main sections (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Button Feedback:** Subtle scale animation on button press (Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Loading States:** Skeleton screens for content loading (Duration: 1000ms, Easing: linear)
- **Playback Visualization:** Animated equalizer during music playback (Duration: continuous, Easing: linear)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals
- **Page Load:** First meaningful paint < 1.5 seconds
- **Interaction Response:** Click/tap response < 100ms
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60 FPS for all animations

### Design Strategies
- Optimize images and artwork for web
- Implement lazy loading for content below the fold
- Use efficient component rendering patterns
- Minimize heavy animations that could impact performance
- Design with progressive enhancement in mind
