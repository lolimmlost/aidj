story_title: Style-Based Playlist Generation
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: Pre-implementation review; strong test design (24 scenarios) and traceability matrix, but no code or tests implemented yet. NFRs show concerns in security, performance, and reliability planning. Recommend implementing P0 tests and validating NFRs before proceeding to Done.
