  "description": "Add \"View Playlist\" Button to Mobile Interface\n\nImplement a \"View Playlist\" button that is visible and fully functional on mobile devices.\n\nRequirements:\n- Add a clearly visible \"View Playlist\" button on the mobile version of the interface\n- Position the button in an accessible location that doesn't conflict with existing mobile navigation\n- Ensure the button meets minimum touch target size of 44x44px for mobile usability\n- Style the button to match existing mobile design patterns and theme\n- Implement appropriate action when button is tapped (navigate to playlist view or open playlist modal)\n- Verify button remains accessible across all common mobile screen sizes (320px to 768px width)\n- Test functionality in both portrait and landscape orientations\n- Ensure button is visible in all relevant app states (scrolled, with keyboard open, etc.)\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n- Very small screens (iPhone SE 320px width) - button should remain fully visible and tappable\n- Tablets in mobile breakpoint (768px) - maintain consistent behavior\n- Devices with notches or safe area insets - ensure button doesn't get obscured\n- When playlist is empty or unavailable - handle gracefully with appropriate messaging\n- Rapid tapping or double-tap scenarios - prevent duplicate actions\n- Loading states - provide feedback if playlist takes time to load\n\nSuccess criteria:\n- Users can easily find and tap the \"View Playlist\" button on any mobile device\n- Button responds immediately to touch input with appropriate visual feedback\n- Playlist displays correctly after button activation\n- No layout shifts or visual glitches when button appears or is interacted with",
