  "description": "Investigate and Fix Song Like Functionality\n\nThe like/favorite action for the currently playing song is not working correctly. When users attempt to like a song, a success toast notification appears, but the heart icon does not update to reflect the liked state.\n\nRequirements:\n- Identify why the heart icon is not filling in after like action\n- Verify the like action is actually persisting to the backend/storage\n- Ensure the UI state properly updates to show the filled heart icon\n- Check if the issue occurs only for the current song or affects all songs\n- Test the unlike functionality to ensure it also works correctly\n- Verify the liked state persists after page refresh or app restart\n- Ensure the toast notification only shows when the action truly succeeds\n\nEdge Cases to Consider:\n- Network failures during the like request\n- Race conditions if user clicks multiple times quickly\n- State sync between the like button and other UI elements showing liked songs\n- Optimistic UI updates vs. actual backend confirmation",
