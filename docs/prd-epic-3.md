# Music Recommendation and Download Interface Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Epic 3: AI Recommendations Engine

## Epic Goal

Implement integration with Ollama to provide AI-powered music recommendations based on user preferences and listening history. This epic will deliver personalized music discovery capabilities while maintaining privacy through local processing.

**MVP Prioritization**: Focus initially on Stories 3.1 and 3.2 for core integration and display. Advanced features (3.3-3.5) deferred until MVP validation.

## Story 3.1: Ollama API Integration

As a developer,
I want to implement API integration with Ollama,
so that the application can generate music recommendations.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Create service layer using TanStack Start's API routes for making API calls to Ollama
2. Implement model selection functionality with environment variables for configuration
3. Handle API responses with standardized error handling patterns
4. Implement error handling for model loading issues with service connection timeout specifications (5s for local services)
5. Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for failed API calls
6. Implement caching for recommendations using Drizzle ORM with SQLite

## Story 3.2: Recommendation Display and Interaction

As a user,
I want to see AI-generated music recommendations,
so that I can discover new music based on my preferences.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Create recommendation display section on the main dashboard using CSS variables for theme implementation
2. Implement different recommendation types (similar artists, mood-based, etc.) with mobile-specific performance optimizations
3. Allow users to provide feedback on recommendations (thumbs up/down) with encrypted storage
4. Create detailed recommendation view with explanations using file-based routing
5. Implement functionality to add recommended songs to play queue with lazy loading
6. Display recommendation generation timestamp with service connection timeout specifications

## Story 3.6: A/B Testing for Recommendation Validation

As a product team,
I want to validate recommendation effectiveness through A/B testing,
so that we can measure user engagement and iterate on the AI engine.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Implement A/B testing framework for recommendation variants (e.g., mood-based vs. similar artists)
2. Track metrics: click-through rates, feedback scores, session time with recommendations
3. Provide dashboard view for test results analysis
4. Ensure privacy compliance (no PII in test data)
5. Automate test deployment and analysis reporting
