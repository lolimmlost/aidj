# Music Recommendation and Download Interface Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Epic 4: Download Management

## Epic Goal

Implement integration with Lidarr to enable searching for and requesting music downloads, with status monitoring. This epic will deliver the ability to expand the music collection through the application interface.

**Deferral Note**: Full Lidarr integration deferred until post-Epic 3 completion. Initial focus on mock interface for UX validation (Story 4.4).

## Story 4.1: Lidarr API Integration

As a developer,
I want to implement API integration with Lidarr,
so that the application can search for and request music downloads.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Create service layer using TanStack Start's API routes for making API calls to Lidarr
2. Implement API key authentication with encrypted session storage
3. Handle search functionality with query parameters and standardized error handling patterns
4. Implement album/artist lookup capabilities with mobile-specific performance optimizations
5. Handle API responses with proper parsing and service connection timeout specifications (5s for local services)
6. Implement error handling for API failures using standardized patterns

## Story 4.4: Mock Download Interface Prototype

As a UX designer/developer,
I want a mock download interface to test UX flows early,
so that we can validate user interactions before full Lidarr integration.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Create placeholder search and request UI using static/mock data
2. Simulate request submission and status updates (pending, in progress, completed)
3. Implement mock notifications and error states
4. Test end-to-end UX flows for download management
5. Document findings and refinements needed for real integration
6. Ensure mock aligns with final design system (CSS variables, responsive)

Points: 3

## Story 4.2: Download Request Interface

As a user,
I want to search for and request music downloads,
so that I can expand my music collection.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Create search interface using CSS variables for theme implementation
2. Display search results with album artwork and metadata using file-based routing
3. Implement download request functionality with environment variables for configuration
4. Show confirmation with proper loading states and retry logic
5. Handle duplicate request detection with Drizzle ORM and SQLite
6. Provide feedback on request submission with standardized error handling

## Story 4.3: Download Status Monitoring

As a user,
I want to monitor the status of my download requests,
so that I know when new music will be available.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Create download status view with mobile-specific caching and lazy loading
2. Display progress information with proper loading states
3. Show estimated completion times with service connection timeout specifications
4. Implement automatic status updates with proper error handling
5. Provide notifications with encrypted session storage
6. Allow users to cancel pending download requests with standardized error handling
