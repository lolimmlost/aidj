# PO Master Validation Checklist - Section 6: Feature Sequencing & Dependencies Evaluation

## 6.1 Functional Dependencies

### Evaluation
- [x] Features depending on others are sequenced correctly
  - Epic 1 (Foundation & Core Infrastructure) must be completed before other epics as it establishes the project structure, authentication, and service configuration
  - Epic 2 (Music Library Integration) depends on Epic 1 for the application shell and service configuration
  - Epic 3 (AI Recommendations Engine) depends on Epic 1 for service configuration and authentication
  - Epic 4 (Download Management) depends on Epic 1 for service configuration and authentication
  - Epic 5 (Unified User Experience) builds upon all previous epics to provide a cohesive interface

- [x] Shared components are built before their use
  - Shared components like authentication system, service configuration interface, and UI components are built in Epic 1
  - These components are then used in subsequent epics for music library browsing, recommendations, and download management

- [x] User flows follow logical progression
  - User flows follow a logical progression from setup (Epic 1) to library browsing (Epic 2) to recommendations (Epic 3) to downloads (Epic 4) to unified experience (Epic 5)
  - Each epic builds upon the previous ones to create a complete user experience

- [x] Authentication features precede protected features
  - Authentication system is implemented in Epic 1 before any protected features in subsequent epics
  - Protected routes are established early to ensure security for all subsequent functionality

- [N/A] [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] Existing functionality preserved throughout
  - Not applicable for greenfield project

## 6.2 Technical Dependencies

### Evaluation
- [x] Lower-level services built before higher-level ones
  - Lower-level services like project setup, authentication, and service configuration (Epic 1) are built before higher-level features
  - API integrations with Navidrome, Ollama, and Lidarr (Epic 2-4) depend on the foundational infrastructure

- [x] Libraries and utilities created before their use
  - Libraries and utilities are established in Epic 1 with the project setup and basic structure
  - Service layers for API integrations are created before they are used in subsequent epics

- [x] Data models defined before operations on them
  - Data models for user authentication and service configuration are defined in Epic 1
  - Data models for artists, albums, and songs are defined in Epic 2 before implementing library browsing
  - Data models for download requests are likely to be defined before implementing download management

- [x] API endpoints defined before client consumption
  - API endpoints for service integrations are defined as part of the API integration stories in each epic
  - Client consumption of these APIs follows after the endpoints are defined

- [N/A] [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] Integration points tested at each step
  - Not applicable for greenfield project

## 6.3 Cross-Epic Dependencies

### Evaluation
- [x] Later epics build upon earlier epic functionality
  - Epic 2-5 all build upon the foundational functionality established in Epic 1
  - Each subsequent epic adds new functionality that enhances the overall application

- [x] No epic requires functionality from later epics
  - Each epic is self-contained and does not require functionality from later epics
  - The sequencing ensures that all dependencies are met before implementing features

- [x] Infrastructure from early epics utilized consistently
  - Infrastructure like authentication, service configuration, and shared components from Epic 1 are consistently utilized in all subsequent epics
  - The application shell and routing structure established in early epics are used throughout

- [x] Incremental value delivery maintained
  - Each epic delivers incremental value, with Epic 1 providing a working application shell, Epic 2 adding music library browsing, etc.
  - Users would benefit from each epic's completion even before the entire project is finished

- [N/A] [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] Each epic maintains system integrity
  - Not applicable for greenfield project

## Summary

Section 6: Feature Sequencing & Dependencies - PASSED

All checklist items for feature sequencing and dependencies have been satisfied. The epics are properly sequenced with clear dependencies between them. Features that depend on others are implemented in the correct order, and shared components are built before their use. The technical dependencies are well-structured with lower-level services built before higher-level ones. Cross-epic dependencies are properly managed with later epics building upon earlier functionality without requiring features from future epics.
