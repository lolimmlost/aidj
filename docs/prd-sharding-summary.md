# PRD Sharding Summary

This document provides an overview of how the original Product Requirements Document (PRD) has been sharded into smaller, more manageable documents for easier navigation and maintenance.

## Original PRD Structure

The original PRD (`docs/prd.md`) contained the following sections:
- Goals and Background Context
- Requirements (Functional and Non-Functional)
- User Interface Design Goals
- Technical Assumptions
- Epics (5 distinct epics with user stories)

## Sharded Documents

To improve manageability and focus, the PRD has been broken down into the following documents:

### 1. Goals and Background Context
**File:** `docs/prd-goals.md`
Contains the project goals and background context information.

### 2. Requirements
**File:** `docs/prd-requirements.md`
Contains both functional and non-functional requirements.

### 3. User Interface Design Goals
**File:** `docs/prd-ui-design.md`
Contains UX vision, interaction paradigms, core screens, accessibility, branding, and target platforms.

### 4. Technical Assumptions
**File:** `docs/prd-technical-assumptions.md`
Contains repository structure, service architecture, testing requirements, and additional technical assumptions.

### 5. Epics
Each epic has been separated into its own document:

- **Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure**
  **File:** `docs/prd-epic-1.md`
  Stories: Project Setup, User Authentication System, Service Configuration Interface

- **Epic 2: Music Library Integration**
  **File:** `docs/prd-epic-2.md`
  Stories: Navidrome API Integration, Music Library Browser, Music Player Implementation

- **Epic 3: AI Recommendations Engine**
  **File:** `docs/prd-epic-3.md`
  Stories: Ollama API Integration, Recommendation Display and Interaction

- **Epic 4: Download Management**
  **File:** `docs/prd-epic-4.md`
  Stories: Lidarr API Integration, Download Request Interface, Download Status Monitoring

- **Epic 5: Unified User Experience**
  **File:** `docs/prd-epic-5.md`
  Stories: Responsive Design Implementation, UI Polish and Consistency, User Preferences and Settings

## Benefits of Sharding

1. **Improved Focus**: Each document can be worked on independently without affecting others.
2. **Easier Navigation**: Team members can quickly find the specific information they need.
3. **Better Maintainability**: Updates to one section don't require modifying a large document.
4. **Parallel Development**: Different teams can work on different epics simultaneously.
5. **Version Control**: Smaller files are easier to track in version control systems.
