story_title: "Navidrome Smart Playlist Integration"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "All 8 acceptance criteria met with comprehensive implementation and 22 passing unit tests. Error handling complete with offline mode, sync conflict resolution, and validation. Core functionality is production-ready. Remaining concerns are non-blocking technical debt (code complexity, logging) recommended for future refactoring."

top_issues:
  - id: "CODE-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "searchSongsByCriteria function is overly complex (200+ lines) with nested loops, multiple strategies, and magic numbers"
    suggested_action: "Refactor into smaller functions: extractArtistSongs(), getGenreAlbums(), applyCriteriaFilters(). Extract magic numbers to named constants (SONGS_PER_ARTIST = 20, etc.)"

  - id: "MAINT-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Excessive console.log statements throughout playlist services"
    suggested_action: "Replace console.log with structured logging framework or categorize logs (debug, info, warn, error)"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Authentication properly implemented in API routes using Better Auth session checks. Input validation via enhanced Zod schema. SQL injection protected by Drizzle ORM."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Adaptive timeout infrastructure via apiFetch (AbortController with 5s default). Database indexes added for navidromeId. TanStack Query caching implemented. Potential concern with searchSongsByCriteria for large libraries."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Offline mode implemented with checkNavidromeConnectivity(). Fallback mechanism for cached playlists. Sync errors handled with 503 status. Comprehensive error handling with retry logic and graceful degradation."
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Code well-structured with TypeScript types and proper separation of concerns. searchSongsByCriteria is overly complex (200+ lines). Excessive console.log statements need structured logging."
